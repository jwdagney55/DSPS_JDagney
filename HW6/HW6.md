I chose to improve the plot I made in HW4 for the Milky Way Galaxy. First I made the y-axis start at 0km/s so as to limit confusion and ambiguity. This also limited the whitespace in the plot which was unused. I also improved the color uses, with black representing the data, and blue, red, and green representing the key points I wanted to highlight.
